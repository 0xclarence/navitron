# NaviTron: TRON Ecosystem Navigation AI

## Problem Statement
When users search for "TRON Ecosystem" on popular search engines like Google, they are directed to the TRON ecosystem page. However, the user interface can be confusing, with no clear indication of which projects offer specific features, especially in areas like DeFi and NFTs. Moreover, platforms like ChatGPT only provide information up to September 2021, which restricts users from accessing details about TRON projects launched post that date. The solution? A conversational AI assistant to guide users through the TRON ecosystem.

## Introduction
NaviTron is a state-of-the-art TRON ecosystem navigation AI, leveraging the power of LangChain and GPT-4. Our team has trained a vector model using comprehensive documentation and feature sets from a curated list of dapps within the TRON ecosystem.

## Quick Test
1. Visit [NaviTron](https://navitron.xyz).
2. Engage in a conversation with NaviTron about the TRON ecosystem.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Chat UI**: A custom-designed chat interface for users to interact with the NaviTron AI.
- **Comprehensive TRON Ecosystem Knowledge**: Ask about anything in the TRON ecosystem. For instance:
  - Inquire about TRX token swaps, e.g., which dapp to swap TRX to USDT.
  - Inquire about various stablecoins available on TRON blockchain.
  - Get details about dapps like Sunswap and how their incentive mechanisms work, e.g. benefits to veSUN holders.
- **Direct Dapp Links**: Provides users with direct links to the dapp's webpage for easy navigation.
- **TRON Hackathon Insights (Bonus Feature)**: Gain insights into various winning projects from all TRON hackathon seasons.

## Currently Supported Dapps (more to come)
- Sunswap
- Transit Swap
- Bitget Swap
- Justlend DAO
- Bridgers
- OKX DEX
- TronNRG
- SocialSwap
- LUMINOUS
- JustMoney Swap
- Tron Sharks

## Future Roadmap
- Launch Beta Version to TRON DAO Community.
- Integrate with TronLink for personalized user wallet insights.
- Enable direct dapp interaction within the chat UI using iframes & TronLink.
- Facilitate custom transactions within the UI for direct dapp contract interactions.
- Propose trading strategies for optimal wallet portfolio management.

## Tech Stack
- NextJS
- ExpressJS
- LangChain
- OpenAI API

## Current Limitations
- Supports a limited number of dapps.
- Relies on data specifically trained by the model; lacks real-time web search capability.

## Milestones
- **Beta Launch**: Targeted by the end of the year.

## Disclosure
This project was initially developed as a prototype for the TRON Hackathon S5. Post-hackathon, our team plans to seek official permissions from TRON DAO and associated ecosystem projects. Our goal is to utilize their data and documentation under mutually agreed terms to enhance our model training for the upcoming beta launch. Feedback from the community is highly appreciated.
